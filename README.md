# HandyNotes: Timeless Isle

A
[HandyNotes](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/handynotes)
plugin for the Timeless Isle zone. This addon is based on
the excellent [Mechagon & Nazjatar
plugin](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/handynotes-mechagon-nazjatar)
itself based on the
[Argus](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/handynotes_argus) and
[Warfronts](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/handynotes-warfrontrares)
plugins.

It will add the locations and rewards for rare mobs and treasures and to the
map. It most notably allows you to track your progress for the very coveted
achievement [Going To Need A Bigger
Bag](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=8728/going-to-need-a-bigger-bag).
